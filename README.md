# SimpleAngularJSExample-uirouter
Simplest case example of an AngularJS app using AngularUI ui-router to demonstrate
view templates with submenus and nested views.

For comparison, also see my example using AngularJS ngRoute.

Created while learning AngularJS, so not intended to be an example of best practices, just a simple example for future reference.
